This folder contains a sample output of the focus-stacking tool found at
(https://pypi.org/project/focus-stack/#description) (Author: Mohit Nalavadi). 

The source code was slightly modified to add support for reading in .tif images from the specified input 
directory since all of the opencv functionality used in the script already supports .tif files. The source
was also modified to resize all of the images in the directory to the same size (the size used by the model
(600,600)) so that they could be used with standard numpy library methods. 

The tool does a decent job of maintaining some of the brain structures but ultimately will not be 
useful as it is for training as it eliminates some of the structures entirely and adds extraneous 
features.
