This folder contains all of the scripts used for dataset preparation and other notes.

Directory: 
3D_Bbox_Crop - Crop bboxes from 3d image stored as .tif file with option for augmentations 
background.py - Add background images to dataset *Needs to be implemented as of 2/29
Downsampling_Distribution - Get distribution of bounding box sizes in dataset 

Notes:
- Directories are listed in the order of which the scripts should be run to prepare the dataset correctly
- 3D_Bbox_Crop creates /results/images and /results/annotations -> background.py adds background images to /results/images 
- Downsampling_Distribution does not rely on the other preprocessing steps, it parses raw dataset 
- background.py will only use Anna's data since it is important that no objects are present in unlabeled images

Ultralytics Dataset Recommendations:
1. >1,500 images per class 
2. >10,000 instances per class labeled
3. Partial labeling is detrimental 
4. 0-10% background images (no objects present) to reduce FP rate - no correspniding .txt label required
